      <p class="docs_description">Welcome to CodeOnline! This documentation serves as a way for you to learn what CodeOnline is, how to use it and write code online.</p>

        <h2 id="section-heading">What is CodeOnline ?</h2>
        <p>CodeOnline is an online editor that's built for improving coding skills.
        Web application development is a growing field, and with all new configuration
        options it becomes harder and harder to focus on writing code. We make this
        easier by doing most configuration for you.</p>
        <p>This focus on coding development allows us to do many more
        optimizations. We can analyze npm dependencies, we can show custom error
        messages for known errors, we can edit this projects easily by downloading
        from Github. The possibilities are endless!</p>
        </section>
        <section id="section-content">
          <h2 id="section-heading">Our Values</h2>
          <p>We started development of CodeOnline with a single goal: make it easy to share
          projects, wherever you are. During development we started noticing other
          benefits though, and we decided to make three focus points for all further
          development.</p>
          </section>
        <section id="section-content">
          <h2 id="section-heading">Lower the Learning Curve</h2>
          <p>With CodeOnline you don't have to do anything to start programming. You don't
          have to set up a development environment, you don't have to install
          dependencies, you don't even need a laptop! During initial development.
          We shifted our focus to make it as easy as possible to start a project, and to
          make UI and UX very simple but useful.</p>
          </section>
        <section id="section-content">
          <h2 id="section-heading">Empower Shareability and Discoverability</h2>
          <p>The initial reason to build CodeOnline was because of shareability.
          The JavaScript community is one of the most active communities out there;
          libraries and projects are shared everyday. Still, it was very hard to share a
          project you've built with, for example, Vue or React. With CodeOnline you can
          easily build, edit or customize our project as you wish.</p>
          <p>We also aim to make discoverability very easy: it should be easy to find
          examples if you're struggling with a logic.</p>
          </section>
        <section id="section-content">
          <h2 id="section-heading">Work as a Local Editor</h2>
          <p>We find it important to support the whole flow of development: from creation, to
          committing, to deployment. You should have your development environment
          everywhere, so you can work whenever you want. We make it possible to build a
          web application from start to finish, without leaving your browser.</p>
